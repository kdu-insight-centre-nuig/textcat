# A fork of Java Text Categorizing Library

## Description

This is a fork of Java Text Categorizing Library by The Knowledge Discovery Unit (KDU), Insight Centre for Data Analytics, National University of Ireland, Galway. Derived from the original work by Thomas Hammerl, available at http://textcat.sourceforge.net/.

## Rationale for Fork

KDU needed to add new features to Java Text Categorizing Library for internal research projects. Original project appears not to have been updated for over 10 years.
